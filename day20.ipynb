    "Here, in the func we have simple hello world program(it behaves as server for us). Our aim is to expose this func to the outer world. Anyone with url should be able to access it. Here, we are trying to create a server(simple machine) with some 100's of functions and we have another system which behaves like client, can access the funcs written inside server. Ex: our client is a browser(it can change as application/lang from where we can execute) .Exposion of this is done by API. We are trying to make it as server with the help of flask. \n",

    "* From client we have to reach out to our computer by a way after reaching may be on some specific port we have some program running there is possibility n number of programs running. One by one we have to access it instead of func name directly(it will not be platform independent)instead we are exposing it as url which is not the lang dependent It follows http protocol. So, we are trying to create route. \n",
