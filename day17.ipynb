    "Whenever we store data we need to store in database. we are during learning currently storing data in variables/file inside our system. Tht's fyn but not completely a solution. Whenever we are building interprice grade application we have to store data set in DB. There are many databases. In one application it is possible even we end up using many databases depending on the application, latency, throughput we are expecting. On higher level we can divide DB in two segments.\n",

    "* Multiple databases here are:  MongoDb,Casandra, HBASE, Influx,Neo4j.\n",
    "* Dffrnces btwn Sql & No Sql: Whenever we try try to store data in Sql. It always works with structured data. Ex: excel(try to create multiple columns, store data row wise) in case of sql we do the same thing. we create table & store. It has DB'S, table,views.., We can perform filter operation,search or query operation, can write joint queries, groupby or any kind of windowing function on top of this structure based on this language \n",
    "* In case of nosql system, it always try to accomodate unstructured data may be as text,audio, images we like to store inside Dffrnt DB'S(dffrnt nosql systems as there are multiple nosql systems designed for dffrnt dffrnt purposes).\n",
